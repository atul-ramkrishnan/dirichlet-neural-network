# Experiments on Dirichlet neural network
This repo contains multiple experiments in using a Dirichlet distribution in a neural network based on the 2019 paper Neural Network Regression with Beta, Dirichlet, and Dirichlet-Multinomial Outputs by Peter Sadowski and Pierre Baldi and the 2020 paper Dirichlet Pruning for Neural Network Compression by Kamil Adamczewski and Mijung Park.
A Dirichlet neural network provides interpretable predictions in the form of multidimensional distributions, rather than point estimates, from which one can obtain confidence intervals or quantify risk in decision making
The repo also includes experiments in using a Generalized Dirichlet distribution and a Beta Liouville distribution instead of the Dirichlet distribution to overcome the limitations of a Dirichlet distribution.
